Imagine I’m snorkeling on a coral reef off Maui, collecting observations for my little underwater photo‐log. First, I sit at the water’s edge, slip on my mask and snorkel, and snug my fins over bare feet—make sure they’re tight but not cutting off circulation. I take a deep breath through the snorkel, ease off the ledge, and kick gently with long, slow strokes so I don’t blast clouds of sand below me. As I drift over the reef, I’m scanning for schools of parrotfish and the bright yellow tangs darting in and out of the corals. Anytime I see something interesting—a clownfish peeking out of an anemone, or a trumpetfish hovering upright—I pause, hold my breath, and point my camera straight down to snap a quick shot without kicking up silt.
