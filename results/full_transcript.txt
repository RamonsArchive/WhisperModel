 Imagine I'm snorkeling on a coral reef off Maui, collecting observations from my little underwater photo log. First, I sit at the water's edge, slip on my mask and snorkel, and snug my fins over bare feet, making sure they're tight but not cutting off circulation. I take a deep breath through the snorkel, ease off the ledge, and kick gently with long, slow strokes so I don't blast clouds or fade below me. As I drift over the reef, I'm scanning for schools of parrotfish and the bright yellow tang darting in and out of the coral. Any time I see something interesting, a clownfish peeking out of the anemone, or a trumpetfish hovering upright, I pause, hold my breath, and point my camera straight down to snap a quick shot without kicking off silk.
